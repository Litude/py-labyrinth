# Labyrinth game created in Python

This is a relatively simple labyrinth kind of game which generated random mazes based on input sizes and lets the player play through these. It also has a maze solver, which can be used to show the way to the goal.

## Requirements

Running the game requires Python 3 (tested with 3.6.3) and PyQt5.

## Running the game

The game can be started by running `main.py`. Some unit tests are also provided which can be started from `test.py`.
